#You will need to obtain a Google Secrets file as a json file. Please place this in the Tokens folder.
#It is best practice to use a service Google account
#Directions on obtaining that file can be found at http://pbpython.com/pandas-google-forms-part1.html

#These lines import some spreadsheets from Google that are imported from Skyward each day.
#The imports first get a student list and then a staff list and then removed duplicates
#The two dataframes are then combined into one so that any lookups of the student user_id can be made from one dataframe
